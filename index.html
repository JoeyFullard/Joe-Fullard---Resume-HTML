    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>I am a very active person, whom enjoys going to the gym and martial arts. 
        I have trained in Muay Thai over the last 10 years, competing in numerous interclubs and even being
    given the opportunity to train in Thailand. This sport has taught me mental perseverance and helped
    me become more disciplined with myself. I have a passion for creating things, 
    self-teaching myself how to code with the hope of getting a job as a software developer</p>
